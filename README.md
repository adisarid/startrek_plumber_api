# Want to talk to R? Call your plumber!

Web APIs are used everywhere to integrate various apps, across platforms and on the web.

The way web APIs work is that by visiting some link with additional parameters appended to the link, you get a response, i.e., a json file, with meaningful results.
In essense, the plumber package enables us, R developers, to share our codeâ€™s products as a web API. This is a good solution when you want to facilitate an easy integration for your clients, without having to expose your R code and your intellectual property.

In my short talk, I will explain about web APIs, present the plumber package and explain the necessary steps to build up a functional web api from the ground up.

Meetup at the 16th of January 2020.
